# Custom Stan Rocker image

Working on getting Stan installed on the `rocker/tidyverse:latest` image, plus some personal `.config` and `.Rprofile` stuff.

So far there have been a number of errors getting Stan and `brms` installed. The `Dockerfile_` files are attempts that didn't work for various reasons.
